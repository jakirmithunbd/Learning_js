        Because '+' can mean either addition or string concatenation. If you pass a string and a number to '+' it always assumes string concatenation. On the other hand '-' only means subtract. So it will attempt to coerce the values passed in to a number.

        Question: This article explains exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for nice explanation. Can you please explain why {} + 15 = 15 instead "[object Object]15" where 15 + {} = "15[object Object]" ?

        ANSWER: 

        I'm glad you find the article helpful!
        {} + 15 = 15 is 15 because JavaScript interprets { } as an empty block statement followed by +15. This construction is equivalent to:

        {
           // empty block
        }
        + 15

        You can add a pair of parenthesis to explicitly define an object literal: ( {} ) + 15="[object Object]15".

        The second case 15 + {}. JavaScript first transforms the object literal into a string, then transforms 15 into a string and concatenates: "15[object Object]".


        Question: Thank you very much for your excellent explanation. Can you also do me a favour explaining why do JavaScript sometimes interprets {} as empty block and sometimes convert it into a string?
